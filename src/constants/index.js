export const BIO_CONTENT = `Hi! My name is Alex and I am a third-year Computer Science student at George Mason University looking to break in to tech as a Software Engineer. 
  With 3 years of hands-on experience, I have honed my skills in languages such as Java, Python, C, HTML, JS and CSS, front-end technologies like 
  React and Next.js, as well as back-end technologies like Node.js, AWS, Firebase, SpringBoot and more. My goal is to leverage my expertise 
  to create innovative solutions that drive business growth and deliver exceptional user experiences.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `More than having a passion for coding, I am a dedicated and lifelong learner, constantly looking grow. 
  The moments in life where I have grown the most stem from failure. Without failiure there is no chance to learn, which is why I always try
  without fearing failure. For example, the first website I built was for a hackathon where my team and I tried to build a web app to
  detect heart disease based off inputted paramaters. We did not win, however the project taught us a lot about web development and machine learning.
  This was my first time using HTML, CSS and JS and also my first learning about machine learning algorithms like KNN and Random Forest.
  The project was not a success, but was still a great learning curve for me. I thrive in team-based environments and enjoy solving complex problems 
  to deliver high-quality solutions.`;
